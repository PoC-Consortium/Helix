Compressor 0.2.0

Change log:

0.2.0

- chunkmode (x=8) is default now. To disable chunk plotting use x=0.

- escalation mode has changed. Escalation parameter is now used to tweak gpu performance by using more RAM. Great with high-end GPUs.

- Multipath mode, parallel plotting: compressor will now automatically use as many buffers as possible to 
  achieve the highest level of parallelisation. E.g. if you specify 8 target drives and have enough memory for 5 buffers, 
  5 drives will always be writing in parallel, round robin (assuming you can hash fast enough). 

0.1.0

- initial release

Todo log:

- resume in chunkmode, (skip finished, redo unfinished)
